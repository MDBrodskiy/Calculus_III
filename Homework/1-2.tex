    \begin{itemize}

      \item Magnitude: $\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}=5$ feet per second

      \item Direction: $\frac{1}{5}\langle 3, 4 \rangle = \langle \frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5} \rangle$

    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Magnitude: $\sqrt{(-6)^2 + (1)^2 + (6)^2}=\sqrt{73}$ meters per second

      \item Direction: $\frac{1}{\sqrt{73}}\langle -6, 1, 6 \rangle=\langle \frac{-6}{\sqrt{73}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{73}}, \frac{6}{\sqrt{73}}\rangle$

    \end{itemize}

  \item

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Magnitude: $\sqrt{(1)^2 + (-1)^2 + (1)^2 + (-1)^2} = 2$

      \item Direction: $\frac{1}{2}\langle 1, -1, 1, -1 \rangle=\langle \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}\rangle$

    \end{itemize}

    \setcounter{enumi}{6}

  \item

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Magnitude: $\sqrt{(2)^2 + (-3)^2 + (1)^2}=\sqrt{14}$

      \item Direction: $\frac{1}{14}(2\bold{i}-3\bold{j}+\bold{k}) = \frac{2}{14}\bold{i} - \frac{3}{14}\bold{j} + \frac{1}{14}\bold{k}$

    \end{itemize}

    \setcounter{enumi}{8}

    \setcounter{enumi}{12}

  \item $1\left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) + 2(-1)=-2.5\Rightarrow \frac{-2.5}{(\sqrt{5}})\left( \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \right)=-1\Rightarrow \cos^{-1}(-1)=0$, thus the angle between them is zero. Because one of the vectors is negative and one is positive, they are in opposite directions.
