    \section{Partial Derivatives}

  \item The slope of $f(x,y)$ depends on the direction in the $xy$-plane

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The slope in the $x$-direction is called the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$

      \item The slope in the $y$-direction is called the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$

      \item Notation: $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ or $f_x$, $f_y$

      \item For Second Derivatives: $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$, $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}$, $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}$, $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}$ or $f_{xx}$, $f_{xy}$, $f_{yx}$, $f_{yy}$

        \vspace{10pt}

        \begin{center}
        If $f,f_x,f_y,$ and $f_{xy}$ are defined in a small disc around $(x_o,y_o)$ and $f_{yx}$ is continuous, then:\\ $f_{xy}=f_{yx}$\\in that disc
        \end{center}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The gradient of $f$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Given $f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$, the gradient of $f$, $\overline{\nabla} f=\left\langle \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \dots, \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right\rangle$

      \item It can be computed at a point: $\overline{\nabla} f(p)=\left\langle \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(p), \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}(p), \dots, \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(p) \right\rangle$

      \item $\overline{\nabla} f\approx f'(x_o)\Delta x$

    \end{itemize}

    \section{Linear Approximation, Tangent Planes, and the Differential}

  \item In calculus I, the linear approximation is given by: $f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$

  \item  In calculus III, the approximation uses the gradient: $\Delta f\approx \overline{\nabla} f(p) \cdot \Delta \overline{x}$

  \item \textit{Ex.\ in $\mathbb{R}^2$} $z=f(x,y)$, $p=(a,b)$:

    \vspace{-20pt}

    $$\Delta f \approx \overline{\nabla}f(a,b) \cdot \langle x-a, y-b \rangle \Rightarrow f(x,y) - f(a,b) \Rightarrow f(a,b) + f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$

    \vspace{-20pt}

    \begin{center}
      Thus:
    \end{center}

    \vspace{-25pt}

    $$f(x,y) \approx f(a,b) + f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$

    \vspace{-15pt}

    \begin{center}
      We find the linearization of $f(x,y)$ near $(a,b)$ (in $\mathbb{R}^2$)
    \end{center}

  \item Linearization of $f(x,y)$ near $(a,b)$ is denoted by $L_f(\overline{x},\overline{p})$, where $p$ is the vector $\langle a, b \rangle$

  \item \textit{Ex. Given a cylinder of radius $r=.5$ and a height of $h=1$, estimate the change in volume when the radius is increased by $.1$ and the height is decreased by $.1$}

    $$V=\pi r^2h\Rightarrow \Delta V \approx 2\pi(.5)(1)(r - .5) + \pi(.5)^2(h - 1) = \pi(r - .5) + .25\pi(h - 1) \approx$$
    $$-.75\pi + \pi r + .25\pi h\Rightarrow -.75\pi + \pi(.6) + .25\pi(.9) = .075\pi$$

    \vspace{5pt}

  \item The graph of $z=L_f(\overline{x},\overline{p})$ is called the tangent set to $f$ at $p$

  \item Differentials

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $df = \overline{\nabla}f\cdot d\overline{x}$

      \item $df = f_xdx + f_ydy + f_zdz$

      \item $df = \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}dx_1 + \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}dx_2 + \dots + \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}dx_n$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Relative Differentials

    \begin{itemize}

      \item $\dfrac{df}{f}$

      \item Think of this as a stencil for relative error $\left( \dfrac{\Delta f}{f} \right)$

    \end{itemize}

    \section{Differentiation Rules}

  \item Linearity of differentiation

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item $\nabla(af\pm bg) = a\nabla f \pm b\nabla g$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Product rule

    \begin{enumerate}

        \setcounter{enumi}{1}

      \item $\nabla (fg)(p)= \nabla f(p)g(p) = \nabla g(p) f(p)$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Quotient rule

    \begin{enumerate}

        \setcounter{enumi}{2}

      \item $\nabla\left( \dfrac{f}{g} \right)\Big |_p=\dfrac{g(p)\nabla f(p) - f(p) \nabla g(p)}{g^2(p)}$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Power rule

    \begin{enumerate}

        \setcounter{enumi}{3}

      \item $\nabla f^{\alpha}(p) = \alpha f^{\alpha - 1}(p) \nabla f(p)$

    \end{enumerate}

    \newpage

  \item Chain rule

    \begin{enumerate}

        \setcounter{enumi}{4}

      \item $\dfrac{df}{dt}=\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}\dfrac{dx}{dt} + \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}\dfrac{dy}{dt} + \dots + \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial z}\dfrac{dz}{dt}\Rightarrow \nabla f \cdot \dfrac{d\overline{x}}{dt}$

    \end{enumerate}

  \item \textit{Ex.} A particle is moving through space. At $t=2$ seconds, the particle is at $(3,4,7)$, and is moving with velocity $\langle -2, 1, 5 \rangle$ meters per second. Suppose that there is also an electric potential in space, given by $\phi(x,y,z)=xy-z^2$ volts. Find the instantaneous rate of change, with respect to time $t$, of the electric potential at the particle's position at $t=2$ seconds.

    $$\dfrac{d\phi}{dt}\Big|_{t=2}=\nabla \phi(\langle 3, 4, 7 \rangle)\cdot \dfrac{d\overline{p}}{dt}\Big|_{t=2}= \nabla \phi(\langle 3, 4, 7 \rangle)\cdot v(2)\Rightarrow$$

    $$\nabla \phi = \langle y, x, -2z \rangle(\langle 3, 4, 7 \rangle) = \langle 4, 3, -14 \rangle \Rightarrow \langle 4, 3, -14 \rangle \cdot \langle -2, 1, 5 \rangle = -75 \text{ volts per second}$$

    \section{The Directional Derivative}

  \item Directions live in the input of the function

  \item Same is true for $\nabla f$

  \item What is rate of change of $z=f(x,y)$ in the direction $\overline{u}$?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Fix point $p$ in $xy$-plane

      \item Choose direction ($\overline{u}$-direction) in $xy$-plane

      \item $D_{\overline{u}}f(p) = \nabla f(p)\cdot\overline{u}$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item This is the derivative of $f$ at $p$ in the direction of $\overline{u}$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Alternative: Fix $f(x,y)$ and point $p$, but $\overline{u}$ varies

  \item What is $\overline{u}$ in which $f(x,y)$ changes in the fastest possible way?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item When the angle between the direction and $\nabla f$ is $\theta = 0$ (because $\cos(\theta)$) is greatest at this angle

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Smallest occurs in opposite directions (when $\theta = \pi$) because $\cos(\theta)$ is the largest possible negative

          \item Equals zero when $\overline{u} \perp \nabla f(p)$ $\left(\textit{i.e. } \theta = \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Thus, $D_{\overline{u}}f(p)$ is largest possible in direction of $\nabla f(p)$

      \item The largest rate is the magnitude of the gradient vector $\left(|\nabla f(p)|\right)$

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The largest rate is the negative magnitude, $-|\nabla f(p)|$

        \end{itemize}

      \item This is all assuming that $\nabla f(p) \neq 0$

    \end{itemize}

    \section{Level Sets and Gradient Vectors}

  \item Given $z=f(x,y)$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Pick a constant, $c$

      \item Plug it in for $z$, such that $f(x,y)=c$

      \item The level curve of $f(x,y)$ corresponding to $c$ is formed

    \end{itemize}

  \item \textit{Ex.} $z=x^2+y^2$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item At $c=-1$, there is nothing to draw because there are no real solutions

      \item At $c=0$, there is one point at the origin $(0,0)$

      \item At $c=1$, we obtain a circle of radius one

      \item At $c=4$, we obtain a circle of radius two

    \end{itemize}

  \item The level curves corresponding to different values of c can not intersect

  \item The gradient vector $\overline{\nabla} f(p)$ is always perpendicular ($\perp$) to the level curve passing through $p$

  \item Implicit functions do not expressly define one variable in terms of different variables (\textit{Ex.} $x^2+y^2=1$), while explicit functions do (\textit{Ex.} $z=\cos(y)+e^x$)

  \item To find the tangent line function, use the formula $\overline{\nabla} f(p) \cdot \langle X - p\rangle = 0$

    \section{Parametrizing Surfaces}

  \item A line in $\mathbb{R}^3$: $\left\{\begin{array}{c} x = x_o + at\\ y = y_o + bt\\ z = z_o + ct  \end{array}$

  \item A circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$: $\left\{\begin{array}{c} x = r\cos(\theta)\\ y = r\sin(\theta)  \end{array}$, where $r$ is the radius

  \item Parametrizing a surface

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Parametrization should be differentiable

      \item Using $u$ and $v$ creates $\overline{r}(u,v)$, so that $\overline{r}_u \times \overline{r}_v \neq 0$

      \item $\overline{r}_u$ should not be parallel to $\overline{r}_v$

      \item A parametrization satisfying this property is said to be regular

      \item \textit{Ex. } Parametrize the cone with equation $z^2=x^2+y^2$: $\left\{\begin{array}{c} x=u\cos(v)\\y=u\sin(v)\\u \end{array}$

    \end{itemize}

  \item The equation of a tangent plane $a\overline{r}_u(u_o,v_o)+b\overline{r}_v(u_o,v_o)$

    \section{Local Extrema}

  \item In Calc I, critical points occurred where $f'(x)=0$ or undefined with the first derivative test, or depending on concavity for the second derivative test

  \item The second derivative test was as follows:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item If $f''(p) > 0$, $p$ is a local min

      \item If $f''(p) < 0$, $p$ is a local max

      \item If $f''(p) = 0$, $p$ is neither

    \end{itemize}

  \item In Calc III, critical points occur where $\nabla f = 0$ or undefined, but the first derivative test is not practical

  \item The second derivative test is now done as:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Hessian Matrix: $\left[ \begin{array}{c c} f_{xx}(p) & f_{yx}(p)\\ f_{xy}(p) & f_{yy}(p)  \end{array} \right]$, then find the determinant:

      \item $D=f_{xx}(p)f_{yy}(p)-f_{xy}^2(p)$

      \item A critical point $p$ is non-degenerate if $D\neq0$

      \item Assuming $p$ is non-degenerate:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item If $D > 0$ and $f_{xx}(p) > 0$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $p$

          \item If $D > 0$ and $f_{xx}(p) < 0$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $p$

          \item If $D < 0$, then $p$ is a saddle point of $f$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Saddle points occur where there are critical points, but a local extreme value is not contained

    \section{Optimization}

  \item Optimization involves finding the largest or smallest value of a function

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Can be constrained or unconstrained

      \item Unconstrained assumes there are no limits on the inputs of a function

      \item Constrained contains limits on inputs

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Unconstrained Case:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Find critical points in the interior of the domain, and find values of the function at those points

      \item Work out the boundaries

    \end{enumerate}

  \item Steps to Solve

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Determine critical points in the interior of the domain. Compute and tabulate the values of function at these points

      \item Proceed to the boundary, and find all critical points interior of the boundary; compute and tabulate

      \item Keep going

    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Lagrange Multipliers}

  \item Lagrange Multipliers

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Find the largest/smallest value of $f$, subject to some constraint (\textit{e.g.} $g=c$)

      \item Compute $\overline{\nabla} f = \lambda\overline{\nabla} g$ (where $f$ is the objective function, and $g$ is the constraining function)

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
