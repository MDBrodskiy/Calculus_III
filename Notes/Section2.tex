    \section{Partial Derivatives}

  \item The slope of $f(x,y)$ depends on the direction in the $xy$-plane

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The slope in the $x$-direction is called the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$

      \item The slope in the $y$-direction is called the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $y$

      \item Notation: $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, $\dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ or $f_x$, $f_y$

      \item For Second Derivatives: $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}$, $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y^2}$, $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x}$, $\dfrac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y}$ or $f_{xx}$, $f_{xy}$, $f_{yx}$, $f_{yy}$

        \vspace{10pt}

        \begin{center}
        If $f,f_x,f_y,$ and $f_{xy}$ are defined in a small disc around $(x_o,y_o)$ and $f_{yx}$ is continuous, then:\\ $f_{xy}=f_{yx}$\\in that disc
        \end{center}

    \end{itemize}

  \item The gradient of $f$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Given $f(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)$, the gradient of $f$, $\nabla f=\left\langle \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \dots, \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right\rangle$

      \item It can be computed at a point: $\nabla f(p)=\left\langle \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(p), \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}(p), \dots, \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(p) \right\rangle$


      \item $\nabla f\approx f'(x_o)\Delta x$

      \item $\nabla f \approx \nabla f \cdot \Delta \overline{x}$

    \end{itemize}
