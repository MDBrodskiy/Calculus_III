\begin{itemize}

  \item The real world creates models, which are used to describe real world phenomena

  \item Don't rely on your mathematical models too much

  \item Calculus 1 and 2 involve differentiation and integration in a two-dimensional space, while Calculus 3 is multidimensional

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Because of this, Calculus 3 involves geometry and algebra, while Calculus 1 and 2 only involve algebra

    \end{itemize}
